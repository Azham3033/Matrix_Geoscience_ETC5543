# Part 1: Review of the Existing Tasmanian Enterprise Suitability Maps (TESMs)
## Current model features

Enterprise Suitability Maps are a map that combine high-resolution digital soil mapping, climate modelling, crop suitability rules. These rate climate, landscape, and soil variables to the requirements of a range of crops. The purpose of this map is to assist farmers, industry, or investors to identify areas where crops or enterprises could potentially be introduced, intensified, or diversified, guiding more detailed investigations at the farm or paddock-scale. possible risks or impediments to growing the crops and mitigation to improve suitability.

Tasmania's Department of Natural Resources and Environment Tasmania alongside Tasmania Institute of Agriculture develop, review, evaluate, and improve the map. Tasmania Enterprise Suitability Maps (TESM) is built from digital soil and climate modelling through on-farm soil sampling and climate sensing (refer to the Digital Soil Mapping and Climate Mapping sections below for further information on these topics). 

The current mapping assumes water for crop irrigation is available and therefore not a limiting factor to production. This assumption is made in order to enable an assessment of land potential based on soil and climate attributes, independent of current water limitations, and to support planning and investment decisions that align with the scope of new irrigation infrastructure projects in Tasmania, particularly those driven by initiatives such as the "Water for Profit" program, which has expanded irrigation capacity and underpinned decision support for Tasmanian agriculture. The program operates through co-investment models where government funds subsidize infrastructure and development costs, but farmers and enterprises contribute financially for access and ongoing usage, so water is not provided free of charge (Kidd et al, 2015).

The range of agricultural commodities covered in this map includes vegetables, cereals, pharmaceuticals, perennial horticulture, pastures, and forestry, with a detailed description of the crop–commodity type pairs provided in @tbl-cropcommodity.

The Tasmanian Enterprise Suitability Maps (TESMs) draw upon a wide array of spatial inputs grouped into soil, climate, and topographic attributes. These inputs are derived from digital soil mapping (DSM) and climate modelling, which generate spatially continuous raster grids of functional attributes across the state. Soil properties such as pH, electrical conductivity, clay percentage, exchangeable calcium and magnesium, stone content, effective rooting depth, and depth to sodic layers form the foundation of the database.

Soil drainage class is a particularly critical input, as it strongly influences whether irrigated enterprises can establish successfully; Kidd et al. (2014) demonstrated that integrating expert-based drainage estimates with DSM techniques produced predictive drainage surfaces with robust validation metrics
 
Climate inputs include frost risk, chill hours, growing degree days, extreme heat risk, and rainfall, all derived from extensive temperature sensor networks combined with terrain covariates

Topographic variables such as slope, elevation, and aspect are incorporated to capture effects on water movement, microclimates, and erosion potential. Together, these inputs are resampled into a consistent gridded format (typically 30–80 m resolution), enabling the creation of suitability surfaces that represent the continuous spatial variability of Tasmanian landscapes.

According to @tbl-allvariables, across the three classes, topography only has 2 variables, as opposed to soil attributes and climates that have more component. This different in number may reflect on how crop suitability being mapped, but this early finding does not determine anything important towards variable selection in TESM.

Tasmania’s Enterprise Suitability Maps (TESMs) are modelled using a deterministic, rule-based framework grounded in digital soil assessment (DSA). The soil component relies on machine learning (interpolation) and geostatistical methods to predict soil attributes from field observations and environmental covariates while quantifying uncertainty. Climate and terrain factors are integrated through threshold rules derived from agronomic literature, expert workshops, and industry consultation.

Each enterprise/crop has a specific rule set defining suitable ranges for soil, climate, and landscape parameters. These thresholds are applied to spatial data layers at 30-meter resolution (high resolution) to produce categorical suitability scores, ranging from Well suited (score 1.0) to Unsuitable (score 4.0). This approach allows users to identify limiting factors, such as frost risk, non-ideal soil depth, etc. and consider risk mitigation options.

Climate inputs come from high-resolution, downscaled regional projections validated with empirical data, incorporating future scenarios for 2030 and 2050 (RCP 8.5) to support adaptation planning. The TESMs also include an Enterprise Versatility Index that aggregates suitability across multiple crops, helping to identify broadly versatile land for sustainable agricultural development in Tasmania. In summary, TESMs combine expert-defined deterministic rules with advanced digital soil mapping to provide a practical, interpretable, and scientifically robust tool for land-use planning, acknowledging inherent limitations in data and modelling assumptions (Kidd et al., 2012; Kidd et al., 2014; Webb et al., 2014; Kidd, 2015; Webb et al., 2018; Kidd et al., 2020).

## Critically assess limitations
  - Missing inputs (e.g. chill hours, pH, drainage, frost exposure) adding new proposed parameters that may help making our map perform better in accuracy.

According to the each crop rules dataset, extracted from the [website,](https://nre.tas.gov.au/agriculture/investing-in-irrigation/enterprise-suitability-toolkit/enterprise-suitability-maps) each crops has different combination of crucial climate variable(s) and topography to consider. This claim supported by [this data](https://nrmdatalibrary.dpipwe.tas.gov.au/FactSheets/WfW/ListMapUserNotes/Inventory_DCM_Tas.pdf) from Tasmanian Goverment. This makes modelling an accurate and reliable model for all crops challenging. Missing data happen in all variables. 

Adding on, by investigating the crops rules dataset _(see Appendix Table A1)_, there are limitations of the lack of common/standardize variables. This makes the mapping harder, since the lack of common variables means the map is less-reliable.

  - Lack of uncertainty estimation or validation  (modelling limitation, compare this with smap and gaez)

Another limitation is in the suitability framework, the integration of these attributes remains deterministic rather than probabilistic. Uncertainty estimates are not considered through into the final TESMs. This makes the maps practical and user-friendly, but at the cost of underrepresenting the variability and confidence levels inherent in the underlying data. with limited flexibility and no formal propagation of uncertainty.

Although LISTmap provides an option to add external layers through formats such as WMS or KML and others _(see Appendix Figure A1)_, the main limitation lies in the availability of suitable data rather than the platform itself. High-resolution spatial datasets for niche or specialty crops are rarely produced because they require costly ground truthing, sensor calibration, and long-term monitoring. Even when data are available from sources such as New Zealand’s S-map or FAO’s GAEZ, the absence of locally collected, large-scale field data in Tasmania prevents the development of reliable crop maps for underrepresented commodities (Zhong et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2024). This scarcity means that specialty crops cannot be mapped with the same spatial detail as mainstream commodities like cereals or fruit. Furthermore, integrating new data into LISTmap is not straightforward. Users must first prepare and host the datasets in platforms such as ArcGIS, then import them manually into LISTmap. Even then, integration may not function seamlessly, and formal inclusion of a new crop layer still requires request to the custodians of Tasmania’s agricultural spatial data at the Department of Natural Resources and Environment.

Equally important is the lack of locally validated crop-specific suitability rules, which are essential for converting soil, climate, and topographic data into meaningful classifications of land potential. Suitability assessments rely on agronomic thresholds such as acceptable ranges for pH, rainfall, or frost tolerance, yet these thresholds are largely absent for specialty crops in Tasmania. As emphasised by Magliocca et al. (2020) and Pramanik et al. (2023), the introduction of new crops is limited not only by the scarcity of environmental datasets but also by uncertainty in defining where and under what conditions they can be successfully cultivated. Together, these gaps in spatial data and suitability rules explain the current inflexibility in extending Tasmania’s Enterprise Suitability Maps to niche or specialty crops.

Despite the robustness of the spatial inputs and the transparency of the rule-based modelling approach, several limitations emerge when moving from data layers to practical suitability maps. The deterministic framework treats thresholds as fixed, without accounting for uncertainty in soil and climate predictions or variability in management practices. Moreover, while the rules capture key agronomic requirements, they may oversimplify interactions between factors such as soil drainage, temperature extremes, and crop management. As a result, the TESMs provide a valuable first-pass planning tool, but their outputs must be interpreted with caution, particularly when extending to niche crops, areas with complex microclimates, or situations where farmers employ adaptive management strategies.

In addition to microclimatic variability, the maps also overlook differences in management practices that strongly influence crop outcomes. Access to water is a clear example: while rainfall and groundwater availability are well mapped, the actual feasibility of irrigation depends on proximity to dams, rivers, or irrigation infrastructure, which is not captured in the current models. Similarly, the effectiveness of pest and disease management can substantially alter yields on land that appears equally suitable in biophysical terms. Crop rotations and seasonal timing also affect soil resilience and productivity in ways that deterministic rules cannot reflect. By standardising these factors, TESMs risk portraying land units as uniform when, in reality, farmers’ practices create significant variation in outcomes. This underscores the importance of integrating management-related variables such as irrigation access and pest or disease pressure into future suitability frameworks, making them more reflective of real-world agricultural conditions.


## Suggested Comparator Models

### **New Zealand S‑map & Crop Suitability Layers** 

New Zealand’s national S-map integrates soil, climate, and terrain data at a 500 m resolution to assess crop suitability, including specialty crops such as truffles, hops, and few specialty wine grapes. It is jointly maintained by Plant & Food Research, Manaaki Whenua – Landcare Research, NIWA, and MPI. Compared to Tasmania’s TESM, the framework includes more explicit representation of biophysical constraints and yields expressed as a range, offering users insight into uncertainty.

  - Inputs: Soil (depth, pH, drainage from S-map), climate (temperature, rainfall from NIWA Virtual Climate Station), and terrain (slope, aspect).

  - Methods: Rule-based GIS modelling adapted from Kidd et al. (2015), similar to modelling reference of TESM, with suitability defined in four categories (well-suited, suitable, marginal, unsuitable) based on most-limiting factor logic. Rules are iteratively refined with expert feedback.

  - Uncertainty: Yield estimates presented as lower and upper bounds, categorical suitability classes carry a “moderate reliability” caveat at national scale.

  - Extensibility: Modular design allows addition of new crops; explicit management scenarios (e.g. irrigation, liming, drainage) demonstrate adaptability to different farm practices.

Compared to TESM, the New Zealand's S-map framework provides national-scale consistency and explicit yield ranges, though with less resolution for fine-grained, farm-level decisions.



### **FAO GAEZ: Agro-MAPS**

The FAO Global Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ) framework, with its Agro-MAPS database, is a global land evaluation system designed to assess agricultural potential under current and future climate conditions. Unlike Tasmania’s TESMs, which are state-level, GAEZ integrates global datasets on soils, climate, terrain, and agricultural statistics to evaluate suitability, potential yields, and yield gaps across multiple scales.

  - Inputs: Climate (historical and scenario-based, e.g., 1981–2010, RCP futures), soils and terrain (from the Harmonized World Soil Database and SRTM slope data), land cover/use, phenology and crop calendars, population and livestock distributions, and national/subnational agricultural statistics (via Agro-MAPS).

  - Methods: Multi-module modelling system. Module I analyses agro-climatic variables (length of growing period, water balance, frost days); Module II calculates biomass and yields; Modules III–IV assess agro-climatic and edaphic (soil/terrain) constraints; Modules V–VII integrate evaluations, downscale production statistics, and compute yield gaps. Suitability is classed by limiting factors across rain-fed and irrigated conditions, with input/management levels considered.

  - Uncertainty: Addressed by scenario modelling (e.g., RCP climate pathways, CO2 fertilisation effects) and by providing ranges for yields and constraints. Downscaling of agricultural statistics incorporates calibration with national data.

  - Extensibility: Highly flexible. GAEZ accommodates multiple management levels, irrigation systems, and climate scenarios, and is updated iteratively (e.g., GAEZ v5 underway). Crop sets can expand, and the framework links to biodiversity, protected areas, and socio-economic overlays for policy support.

Compared to TESMs, GAEZ provides much broader geographic scope and scenario-based foresight, but at coarser resolution and less direct farm-scale applicability.
