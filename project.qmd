# Objective

To support the development of a flexible, high‑resolution modelling framework by conducting a structured literature review of:

1. The **existing Tasmanian Enterprise Suitability Maps (TESMs)** – their inputs, methods, and limitations  
2. Comparable **crop suitability models** from other regions  
3. **Emerging, high‑value, or climate‑resilient crops** suitable for Tasmania’s cool temperate climate  

Your review will guide improvements to TESMs and the inclusion of specialty crops (e.g. truffles).

# Part 1: Review of the Existing Tasmanian Enterprise Suitability Maps (TESMs)

## Tasks

- **Summarise current model features**  
  - List/tabulate all crops currently included  
  - Identify spatial inputs (e.g. rainfall, soil type, temperature, slope)  
  - Describe modelling approach (deterministic rules, scoring thresholds)  
  - Note assumptions (irrigation assumed, no uncertainty, uniform management)  

- **Critically assess limitations**  
  - Missing inputs (e.g. chill hours, pH, drainage, frost exposure)  
  - Lack of uncertainty estimation or validation  
  - Inflexibility for adding niche or specialty crops  
  - Over generalization (ignoring micro climates, management practices)  

## Suggested Comparator Models

Briefly describe **2–3** of the following alternative suitability frameworks, focusing on inputs, methods, uncertainty, extensibility:

- **New Zealand S‑map & Crop Suitability Layers** (Manaaki Whenua – Landcare Research)  
  - Includes truffles and other specialty crops  
  - Integrates soil, climate & management  
  - Modular and extensible design

- Victorian Horticulture Crop Suitability Framework  
- Queensland Land Suitability Guidelines (DES)  
- FAO EcoCrop / GAEZ  
- USDA Crop Suitability Tools  
- CSIRO land evaluation frameworks

# Part 2: Literature Review on Emerging & Climate‑Resilient Crops

## Selection Criteria

Identify crops that are:

- **Not** in TESMs  
- High‑value or specialty (e.g. truffles, saffron, hops)  
- Climate‑resilient (drought/frost/salinity tolerance)  
- Suitable for regenerative, small‑scale systems in Tasmania  
- Under trial or limited local production (bonus)

## Crop Summary Requirements

For each candidate crop, capture at minimum the details required as inout to the existing TESM, and any others indentified from your literature review, e.g:

- **Climatic**: temperature range, rainfall, chill hours, frost/heat tolerance  
- **Soil**: texture, drainage, pH, organic matter  
- **Topography**: slope, elevation suitability  
- **Water**: irrigation needs or dryland tolerance  
- **Management**: pest/disease issues, growing season, pollination  
- **Markets**: value, demand trends, Tasmanian viability  
- **Model Inputs**: spatial variables you could add to TESMs

# Deliverables

1. **Narrative Report** (4–6 pages)  
   - Executive summary  
   - TESMs overview & limitations  
   - Comparator model insights  
   - 5–10 recommended crops (with focus on truffles)  
   - Recommendations for new inputs & uncertainty handling  

2. **Reference List**  
Please only use Peer‑reviewed journals, government & industry reports. Use reference formatting according to Monash unit guidelines.
